Leonard is an Austrian flight attendant with a German airline. 
We met him on duty this weekend. He shared that he served as a United Nations soldier on the Golan Height until he retired from the army about a year ago when Austria withdrew its soldier UN contingent as Syria descended into Somalia and the situation became too dangerous. 
ISIS began bombing the Israeli side, who bombed back, the UN peacekeeping force in crossfire.
Leonard visited Alleppo, Damascus and Palmyra, which just fell into ISIS hands. All this millennia old archeological and cultural beauty is gone with the war, he worries.
