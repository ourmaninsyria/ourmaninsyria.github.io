Prior to being elected as Co-Governor of Derbesie, (a city in Northern Syria) she was a student of Civil Engineering in Raqqa, Syria. 
The war interrupted her studies. "My fellow Governor, Hamid Maish, and myself sacrifice ourselves to serve our people's needs. 
Lots of martyrs sacrificed themselves and we are proud to be here."
