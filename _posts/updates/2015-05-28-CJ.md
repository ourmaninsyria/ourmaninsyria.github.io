36 year old Commander Chijak is in charge of the front line with ISIS near Sere Kanie and the Turkish border. 
We follow her and the female platoon to this hill that changed hands a few times. 
There she picks one of the bullet cases left on the ground from ISIS's last surprise night attack 2 days ago, they repulsed successfully.
