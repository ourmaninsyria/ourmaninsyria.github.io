The children in Kobane are not vaccinated.This is because they missed their revaccination (booster vaccination) thanks to the war. 
Dr Hikmet Ahmad, director of the MSF (Doctors Without Borders) hospital in Kobane told me that when he asked the United Nations office in Antep,Turkey to send vaccines last week, 
they allegedly responded "but there are no children in Kobane".
