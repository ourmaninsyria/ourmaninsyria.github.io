The Democratic Union Party ([PYD](http://www.pydrojava.net/en/index.php/about)) aims to shatter existing boundaries within Syria's ethinically stratified society. However, we wanted to get a grasp of the real story, straight from the Front Line.

**1) Are you partnering or fighting with the Assad regime? Is co-operation with the Islamists a deemable idea?**

We are neither partnering nor fighting the Regime. They are not attacking us currently because they arenâ€™t capable. Even though the injustices of the regime were directed towards the Kurds we are currently focused on defending our land from the Islamist groups. The reality is that today it is the Daesh but tomorrow it can be Al Nusra who attacks us. The regime and the Islamists are basically the same ideology- not good for the Kurds or any other minority right. 


**2) What is the importance of the [PYD](http://www.pydrojava.net/en/) in Rojava?**

Rojava consists of 3 cantons. PYD was a strong force at the beginning of the autonomy but now it is only one of 11 parties governing Rojava. There are also 50 civic, youth, cultural, and social organizations organizations operating in Rojava. Turkmens, Arabs, Assyriens are represented by those parties and organizations. People tend to think that PYD is the dominant party in Syria Kurdistan but not anymore. It became a minority party in the government. It is simply that PYD adopted the right strategy which transformed into a holistic Rojava Strategy.Our party also has non Kurdish members even though our management is primarily Kurdish.

 

**3) What are the chances of the Regime surviving? Do you think the Free Syrian Army stands a chance?**

The regime is surviving only because of Russia and Iran. Its end is near unless it recognizes and deals with minority rights and Kurdish issues. For now,the Kurds are getting helped by France [(former colonists)](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/578856/Syria/29921/The-French-mandate). The Free Syrian army is really weak and strongly Islamist, oscillating between Al Nusra and Daesh.
