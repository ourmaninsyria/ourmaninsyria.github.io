We had tea and conversation with Rodin Dabi, a 25 year old civil engineer, who is co-pr√©siding over the committee in charge of the reconstruction of Kobane. 
She reveals to us about her experience in Kobane after the ISIS invasion, with about 50% of the city houses destroyed. 
As ISIS closed in last year she left for Turkey with her two year old daughter Melal. 
However life was hard and expensive and after her daughter fell sick she decided to come back where they had left off for a new beginning in Kobane. 
"I want a future for my daughter in Kobane. "Our biggest challenge now is a lack of clean water as it comes from the wheels. 
We are also very afraid of the unexposed bombs,"she says. What has changed in the new Kobane? "When I went to the university in Aleppo we could not say 'I am kurdish';
Today my daughter speaks Kurdish." What about the future, we ask. "We have to change the way we think. We need teachers and education experts from the West, 
so schools can teach how to think and want, not only tell kids to do or not to do things." We want minds not machines, she concludes.
