"Free clinic" in Qamishlo where Dr. Jihan Shaeen, a 35 year old, mother of three works as a pediatrician part time for free in the Alhalalia district, along with her husband, a gynecologist. 
She strives to reach a balance between family and her two jobs at the private and free clinics but is struggling.
"Everything will be ok, if we can win over the terrorists (ISIS) who attack us,"she says.
